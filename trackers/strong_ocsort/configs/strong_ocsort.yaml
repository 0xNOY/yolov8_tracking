# StrongOCSort performs association in 3 steps:
#
# For all detections with confidence above DET_THRESH:
#   1. Associate using feature matching (StrongSort)
#   2. Associate using trajectory matching (OCSort)
#
# For all detections with confidence below DET_THRESH, if USE_BYTE is True:
#   3. Associate using byte association

  ecc: True               # activate camera motion compensation
  ema_alpha: 0.9          # updates  appearance  state in  an exponential moving average manner
  iou_treshold: 0.2      # Gating threshold for IOU association. Associations with cost larger than this value are disregarded.

  min_hits: 3             # Number of frames that a track remains in initialization phase
  max_dist: 0.18          # The matching threshold. Feature samples with larger distance are considered an invalid match

  use_byte: True          # Use byte association for detections with confidence under DET_THRESH
  use_resurrection: False # Turns on the resurrection system. Allows dead tracks to be revived if an unmatched detection feature matches with the dead track's feature history, controlled with MAX_DIST.
